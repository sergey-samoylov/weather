# Simple weather app

Here's what you can do with Guizero - simple but beautiful GUI.

Still prefer laconic CLI interface.

All you need are three files: weather_app.py, weather_time.py and requirements.txt.

And it will work with openweathermap or any other similar service.
So you have to use your own login and password to get the data.

Have fun!
